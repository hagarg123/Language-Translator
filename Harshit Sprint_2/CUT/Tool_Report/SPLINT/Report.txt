src/server.c:1: Include file <sys/socket.h> matches the name of a POSIX
    library, but the POSIX library is not being used.  Consider using +posixlib
    or +posixstrictlib to select the POSIX library, or -warnposix to suppress
    this message.
  Header name matches a POSIX header, but the POSIX library is not selected.
  (Use -warnposixheaders to inhibit warning)
src/server.c:1: Include file <netinet/in.h> matches the name of a POSIX
    library, but the POSIX library is not being used.  Consider using +posixlib
    or +posixstrictlib to select the POSIX library, or -warnposix to suppress
    this message.
src/server.c:5: Include file <unistd.h> matches the name of a POSIX library,
    but the POSIX library is not being used.  Consider using +posixlib or

  warning)

src/server.c:65:15: Function memset expects arg 2 to be int gets char: '0'
  A character constant is used as an int. Use +charintliteral to allow
  character constants to be used as ints.  (This is safe since the actual type
  of a char constant is int.)

                       accept (..., (struct sockaddr *)NULL, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
src/server.c:90:42: Null storage passed as non-null param: accept (..., NULL)
src/server.c:94:8: Argument to exit has implementation defined behavior: 1
  The argument to exit should be 0, EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE (Use -exitarg
  to inhibit warning)
src/server.c:96:8: Test expression for while not boolean, type int: 1
src/server.c:99:4: Unrecognized identifier: bzero
  Identifier used in code has not been declared. (Use -unrecog to inhibit
  warning)
src/server.c:101:4: Assignment of ssize_t to int: n = recv(in, buff, 256, 0)
  To allow arbitrary integral types to match any integral type, use
  +matchanyintegral.
src/server.c:105:9: Argument to exit has implementation defined behavior: 1
src/server.c:110:47: Possibly null storage word passed as non-null param:
                        printf (..., word, ...)

   src/server.c:113:13: Storage tl may become null
src/server.c:115:11: Variable nbuff shadows outer declaration
  An outer declaration is shadowed by the local declaration. (Use -shadow to
  inhibit warning)
   src/server.c:62:7: Previous definition of nbuff: char [1024]
src/server.c:118:5: Return value (type ssize_t) ignored: send(in, nbuff, ...
src/server.c:122:3: Fresh storage nbuff not released before scope exit
  A memory leak has been detected. Storage allocated locally is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreefresh to inhibit
  warning)
   src/server.c:115:41: Fresh storage nbuff created
src/server.c:123:4: Return value (type int) ignored: close(in)
src/server.c:123:4: Unreachable code: close(in)
